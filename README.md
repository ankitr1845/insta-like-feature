This project showcases a simple yet engaging heart animation effect triggered by a double-click on an image. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features an image container where a heart icon appears upon double-clicking, scales up, fades out after one second, and then shrinks back to its original size after two seconds. The animation effect is achieved through CSS transitions and JavaScript event handling. The project utilizes the Remix Icon library for the heart icon and an image sourced from Unsplash.
